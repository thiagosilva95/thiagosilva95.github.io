Hi! My name is **Guilherme Duarte Marmerola**, and I'm a Data Scientist from Brazil. I'm passionate about machine learning, and the power it gives us to solve real problems in business and science. I graduated in Electrical Engineering from the University of Campinas and had the fortune of discovering ML in my early undergraduate years, totally by chance, during an internship at NICTA, in Syndey, Australia. Since then, Iâ€™ve literally fallen in love with the discipline, and built many successful advanced analytics initiatives in the media, mining, insurance, retail, consumer goods and banking industries.

I hold a special interest about some specific topics:

1. **Reinforcement learning:** particurlarly, I'm interested in the exporation-exploitation dilemma, and how to solve it with (bayesian) models that capture uncertainty. I'm devoting a lot of time to the study of bandit problems, and how to use them as frameworks to fundamental problems in industry (pricing, applying treatments, deciding which data to collect, etc.).

2. **Dimensionality reduction and clustering:** how can we visualize and interpret structure in our data, aiming to explain it to business stakeholders? Can we do better than simple K-Means clustering? What similarity measures, algorithms and representations would make this possible?

3. **Management, and data science in a business context:** doing data science in industry is far from trivial as we need to balance time for experimentation with deadlines, data is oftentimes messy and stakeholders may not have a clear understanding of our work and challenges. How can you navigate this and deliver real value from ML, while maintaining the best people motivated?

I hope I can bring useful insights about these topics and others. Feel free to [contact me](https://gdmarmerola.github.io/contact), and also add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdmarmerola/)!
