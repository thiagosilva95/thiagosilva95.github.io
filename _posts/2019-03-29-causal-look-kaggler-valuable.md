# A Causal Look At What Makes a Kaggler Valuable

I have not posted for some time now, but I'm back with a Kernel on Kaggle, using causal inference to determine what titles and skills will make you earn more, using the 2018 State of Data Science Survey. I really liked using Kernels (it was my first time), as it is the same as using a notebook on the cloud, with good infrastructure (4-core, 16GB RAM machine on the backend!).

Hope it makes a good reading! You can access the Kernel with the following link:
